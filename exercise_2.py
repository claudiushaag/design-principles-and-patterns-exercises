# TODO: The `ShoppingCart` allows for addition of products into it, and finally allows to export
#       the list of products into different file formats - currently xml and json are supported.
#       However, the `ShoppingCart` does not scale well in case exporting into other file formats
#       is to be added, because you have to modify the class for each new file format by adding a
#       new export function. Over time this may lead to the class blowing up. Also, the current
#       implementation violates the DRY principle...
#       To solve these issues, we want to use dependency injection, injecting (for instance) a
#       `ShoppingCartWriter` into a generic `export` function. Thus, usage may look like this,
#       for instance:
#
#       cart = ShoppingCart()
#       # add products...
#       cart.export(XMLShoppingCartWriter(filename="cart.xml"))
#
#       This way, it is possible to export a shopping cart into new data formats without having
#       to change the `ShoppingCart` at all. One only has to implement a new writer class for
#       the new format, that fulfills the interface that your `export` function requires.
#
#       Note: in case you were wondering, we ignore product prices here because price handling
#             may have been changed in exercise_1...
